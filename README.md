#### Items with a star (★) next to them are things I highly recommend

<details><summary>About/Explanation</summary>

### For the clueless

**Mods** are modifications, these are all using the Fabric mod loader. File path: .minecraft\mods

**Resourcepacks** are alternative textures applied to objects in the game. These are all client side, so only you will see these changes, and they will work on other servers. Filepath: .minecraft\resourcepacks

**Shaderpacks** are shaderpacks. I use only one really. Loaded with Iris mod

**Options** is my options I use. Filepath: .minecraft\

**Schematics** are my commonly used schematics for the Litematica mod. Filepath: .minecraft\

**miniHUD and tweakeroo .json** are my configurations for miniHUD and tweakeroo. Good place to start if you're lost. .minecraft\config\
