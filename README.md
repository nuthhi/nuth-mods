# nuth-mods

### Nuth_AN's collection of minecraft mods, resourcepacks, and datapacks

Client side means they will work on vanilla (unmodded) servers and are specific to your computer.

Server side means they have to be installed on the server and the client to function.

**Mods** are modifications, these are all using the Fabric mod loader. Mods can be client OR server side. Each one will specify. File path: .minecraft\mods

**Resourcepacks** are alternative textures applied to objects in the game. These are all client side, so only you will see these changes, and they will work on other servers. File path: .minecraft\resourcepacks

**Datapacks** are only server side and are world specific. File path:.minecraft\saves\worldname\datapacks

Items with a star (â˜…) next to them are things I highly recommend

Items with a bell (ðŸ””) next to them are things I use on nuthSMP
